## What Emotional Intelligence Is

Emotional intelligence is a person's ability to understand and manage their own emotions, and to understand and positively influence the emotions of others.

At least, thats the gist of it. Emotional Intelligence, sometimes referred to
as _Emotional Quotient_, or _EQ_ for short, is difficult to nail down with a comprehensive and precise definition. For many people, there will always be intangible components, and aspects that are hard to capture with words.

At thoughtbot, we have endeavored to define EI in a way that espouses our culture of inclusivity. We seek to continuously improve this definition, our
understanding of it, and our expression of it. Ultimately, we would like to enact and inspire positive change in the world through our inclusive culture. This journey is not ours alone, and we invite you to contribute.
